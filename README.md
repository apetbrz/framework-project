# A Comparison of Web Server Frameworks across a Selection of High-Level Programming Languages

In this project, I am comparing multiple popular web frameworks, for performance and ease of development.

For each framework, I'll follow their documentation and guidance towards developing a simple REST API for each, take notes along the way for how developer-friendly the experience is, and then benchmark them on response time, resource utilization, throughput, etc.

### Usage Notes:

- Axum:

`cargo run`

- Django:

`python manage.py runserver`

- .NET:

Run through VSCode

- Express:

`npm run dev`

- Gin:

`go run main.go`

- Ruby on Rails:

`ruby bin/rails server`

- Spring:

`./gradlew bootRun`
