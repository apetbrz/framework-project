# A Comparison of Web Server Frameworks across a Selection of High-Level Programming Languages

In this project, I am comparing multiple popular web frameworks, for performance and ease of development.

For each framework, I'll follow their documentation and guidance towards developing a simple REST API for each, take notes along the way for how developer-friendly the experience is, and then benchmark them on response time, resource utilization, throughput, etc.

### Usage Notes:

- Axum:

`cargo run` hosted on port 3000


- .NET:

`dotnet run` hosted on port 5217

- Express:

`npm run dev` hosted on port 3000

- Gin:

`go run main.go`
