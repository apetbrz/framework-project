# A Performance Comparison of Modern Web Frameworks
### Arthur Petroff, USC Upstate CSCI 599 - Senior Seminar, Spring 2025

This is a study into web back-end framework performance and efficiency. Four frameworks were selected to develop small testing APIs, which were then benchmarked across four different tests of varying computational requirements. The four frameworks are as follows:

- ASP.NET (C#)
- Axum (Rust)
- Express (JavaScript)
- Gin Gonic (Golang)

Testing was done using [rewrk](https://github.com/lnx-search/rewrk), automated through shell scripts, with data plotted using R.

## Procedure:

### 0. Prerequisites

`Docker version 28.0.4`

### 1. Setup

- Clone this repo (https://github.com/apetbrz/framework-project.git) onto both the hosting server device and the latency testing client device.
- On the server, run `build.sh` to build the docker image, then `run.sh` to start it up.

### 2. Running a test

- On the interactive docker container, use `runserver [framework name]` to start each server.
  - `axum`, `asp.net`, and `gin` can all be shut down with CTRL+C
  - `express` can be stopped with `runserver stopexpress`
- Resource usage was monitored with the `watchresources.sh` script on the server using tmux.
- On the testing client, use `test_scripts/runtests.sh` to start each benchmark.
